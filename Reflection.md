The overall approach was terrible!!!! I started too late. But I think I really pulled through!!! Last night I pulled an all nighter to finish this project. After the all nighter I was running into issues. I learned so many awesome things. I feel way more confident with for each and while loops. I am really really proud with what I made. Considering I made this by myself I think I really outdid myself. I did not think I was going to make a good game but I think this game is pretty awesome. But I really wish I got the ball rolling a lot sooner so I did not have this much stress. If I had unlimited time I would work on the prompts and make more! More prompts more fun! YAY
