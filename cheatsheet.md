This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

These commands can be used at anytime throughout the game (excluding the challenges).
Commands: 
'help' - shows the commands avalibable
'open backpack' - opens backpack to see collected items
'check recipe' - checks the recipe for the Sin Cake (used as a guide)
'drop' - drop items (can actually only drop items NOT in the recipe)

Challenges:
CC: The CC has pecans that are not actually needed in the recipe. There is only limited space in the backpack so if player picks them up they will need to drop pecans before picking up an ingredient actually needed for the recipe. This offers a complication making the game more dynamic. 

Nogi: The sugar ingredient is locked away behind a safe. The safes code is the year Julia Child graduated from Smith College (1934). This year is actually on the Campus Center building sign. 

Tyler: The player is supposed to pick between 3 options of chocolate. The only way the player will know which chocolate is needed is to check the recipe. This forces the player to use the check recipe command. The correct answer is Dark Chocolate.

Barn: To collect the milk needed for the recipe the player must speak to the farmer and answer this question correctly: What is the name of a baby cow?. A baby cow is called a calf.

Hubbard: The final meeting spot is here. To bake the cake succefully the player must have Sugar, Milk, and Dark Chocolate in their backpack. If they do not have these items they will be sent back to the CC to continue searching.
